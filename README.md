# -REGRESSION-MODEL-TO-PREDICT-CEMENT-COMPRESSIVE-STRENGTH

## Introduction

Predicting the compressive strength of cement is essential in construction and civil engineering. This project aims to develop a regression model that can accurately predict the compressive strength based on various features and attributes of the cement mixture.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the [data](/data) directory. It includes information about different cement mixtures and their corresponding compressive strength values.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryawaghmare/REGRESSION_MODEL_CEMENT_COMPRESSIVE_STRENGTH.git
   cd REGRESSION_MODEL_CEMENT_COMPRESSIVE_STRENGTH
